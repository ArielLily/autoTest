## Two Line Summary\nAutomatically retrieve inventory data from vManage and list a summary of all devices in the network.\n\n## Use Case Summary\nThis sample Python code uses the Cisco SD-WAN REST API to connect to vManage, retrieve a list of devices under management, and display that list.\n\nThe Cisco SD-WAN REST API is a programmatic interface for controlling, configuring, and monitoring the Cisco SD-WAN devices in an overlay network. You access the REST API through the vManage web server. The API is documented on the vManage host, and you can access the documentation by using your browser to navigate to `https://<vmanage-ip-address>/apidocs`. Additional API documentation can be found in the [Cisco SD-WAN Product Documentation](https://sdwan-docs.cisco.com/Product_Documentation).\n\n## Objectives \n* Explore how the Cisco SD-WAN REST API allows the user to configure, control, and monitor SD-WAN devices in an overlay network.\n* Does the authentication process using Vmanage API.\n* Automatically retrieve inventory data from vManage and list a summary of all devices in the network.\n\n## Requirements\nIt is recommended that this code be used with Python 3.6. It is highly recommended to leverage Python Virtual Environments (venv).\n\n## Video Tutorial\nhttps://youtu.be/mx2-_4mn1l0
